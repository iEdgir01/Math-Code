#code to solve the puzzle :
#Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - 
#the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.
#An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.
